# The Art of Startup Finance - Financial Budgeting - Your Operating Budget

In this video, Bill Reichert, from Kauffman Founders School, dives into the complexities of financial budgeting, specifically focusing on the operating budget. He emphasizes the significance of understanding your business's key drivers and milestones when creating a budget.

Reichert suggests avoiding generic templates and instead aligning your budget with your milestones, which provides a more meaningful framework for both internal and external stakeholders. He stresses the iterative nature of budgeting, explaining that it's subject to adjustments and requires regular monitoring.

He recommends preparing a 12-month operating budget with monthly breakdowns, alongside visibility into the following two quarters. The level of detail in the budget should evolve with the company's experience and data availability.

Finally, Reichert advises against excessive cushioning in the budget. Instead, he encourages a balanced approach, incorporating realistic estimates with some buffer around each element. By aligning your budget with milestones and incorporating a collaborative approach, you can effectively manage your company's finances and increase your chances of success.
