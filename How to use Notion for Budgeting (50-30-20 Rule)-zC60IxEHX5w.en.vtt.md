# How to use Notion for Budgeting (50-30-20 Rule)

In this video, we'll guide you through a simplified budgeting process using the 50/30/20 rule in Notion. With this monthly exercise, you'll allocate your income wisely, fostering a balanced financial life.

To kick things off, create two Notion databases: one for an overview and one for categorizing your expenses. Begin by converting the overview page to a full-width view for a more comprehensive layout.

Next, establish the Categories database with a table view, listing expense categories like rent, groceries, and entertainment. Assign unique icons to each category for easy identification. Add two number properties: "Budget Amount" and "Actual Amount," representing your planned and actual expenses respectively. Don't forget to specify your preferred currency format.

Now, let's delve into the 50/30/20 rule. Allocate 50% of your income to needs (essential expenses), 30% to wants (discretionary spending), and 20% to savings (future goals). These percentages can be adjusted based on your income and lifestyle, as long as they add up to 100%.

Create a second table view in the Overview database, labeled "Type," to represent the three categories: Needs, Wants, and Savings. Add a number property for "Income Percentage" with the respective percentages (50, 30, 20) and another number property for "Budget." Calculate the budget for each category based on your estimated monthly income.
