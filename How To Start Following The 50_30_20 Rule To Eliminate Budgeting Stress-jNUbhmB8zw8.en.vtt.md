# How to Start Following the 50/30/20 Rule to Eliminate Budgeting Stress

Introducing the 50/30/20 budget rule, a simple and effective method for managing your finances. This technique divides your income into three categories: necessities (50%), savings (20%), and leisure spending (30%).

Necessities include essential expenses like rent or mortgage payments, transportation costs, groceries, utilities, and debt repayment.

Tracking your spending is crucial for successful budgeting. Create a spreadsheet or use budgeting apps to categorize your expenses and monitor your progress.
