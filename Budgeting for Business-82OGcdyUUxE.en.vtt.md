# Budgeting for Business

In this video, I'll share how I apply the budget-by-paycheck method to my business finances. Just like in my personal life, I track all business expenses manually and categorize them for easy management. The key difference is that I budget monthly for my business due to the different structure compared to personal paychecks.

To simplify the process, I use QuickBooks solely to enter transactions and categorize spending. This makes it easier for my accountant to review my finances. However, the core principles remain the same as in my personal budgeting. I believe it's crucial to keep personal and business finances separate, both for accounting and mindset reasons.

For small business owners, it's essential to consider the future of your business without relying on debt. This may require strategic adjustments, such as scaling down product demand if finances don't allow for expansion. The goal is to create a business that can thrive without the burden of debt, ensuring its long-term success and financial stability.
