# How To Set an Annual Budget

40% of Americans don't bother with financial resolutions, and 68% admit to having no written financial plan. An annual budget can help you establish clear financial goals and understand what you want to achieve. Budgeting can be daunting, but it's crucial for understanding your income and expenses.

Begin by examining your pay stubs to determine your take-home pay, which is used for budgeting. Add in any contributions to retirement plans to get a comprehensive view of your income. Divide your bi-weekly paycheck by 26 or your bi-monthly paycheck by 24 to estimate your monthly income.

Scrutinize your bank statements to understand your spending habits. Categorize expenses as fixed (unchanging) or variable (fluctuating). Fixed expenses include rent, mortgage, car payments, and student loans. Variable expenses encompass groceries, dining out, clothing, and miscellaneous purchases.

Establish a primary objective to guide your budgeting strategy. Common goals include building an emergency fund, saving for retirement, or paying down debt. Experts recommend prioritizing saving by "paying yourself first" before allocating funds to other expenses.

The 50-30-20 budget is a helpful guideline: 50% of your income goes to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. This structure provides a balance between necessities, discretionary spending, and financial future planning. Remember, budgeting is an ongoing process that requires regular review and adjustments to ensure you stay on track.
