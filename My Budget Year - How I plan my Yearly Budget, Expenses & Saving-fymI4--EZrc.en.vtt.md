# My Budget Year - How I plan my Yearly Budget, Expenses & Saving

In this video, I'll guide you through creating a well-planned budget that incorporates yearly expenses, empowering you to kick off the year with financial confidence. Budgeting has been a part of my life for seven years, initially driven by the need to manage debt and later as a tool for financial empowerment.

To begin, choose a budgeting method that works for you, whether it's a simple notebook, an Excel spreadsheet, or a dedicated budgeting app. Once you've settled on your system, it's time to plan for yearly expenses that don't fall into your regular monthly bills. Think Christmas presents, birthdays, insurance premiums, car repairs, and the dreaded dental check-ups. List these expenses and their estimated costs, then divide the total by 12 to determine the monthly amount you need to set aside.

Next, create a monthly budget that includes all your essential categories: rent, food, household items, transportation, phone bills, and your calculated yearly expenses. Don't forget to include an amount for unexpected expenses. Keep your budget realistic, and adjust it as needed based on your spending habits.

To succeed, it's crucial to regularly review your budget. Check your accounts weekly or bi-weekly to identify any overspending and adjust your categories accordingly. This will help you stay on track and avoid surprises.

Finally, don't be afraid to set financial goals and motivate yourself with them. Whether it's saving for a down payment on a house or investing in your future, having a clear purpose behind your budgeting will keep you focused and driven to stick to it.
