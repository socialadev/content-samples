# Budget vs. Your Actual Spending

In this video, we delve into the significance of understanding the difference between what you estimate you'll spend in your budget and what you actually end up spending. This is a crucial aspect of financial management, and the "Budget by Paycheck Workbook" helps you track this information effortlessly.

The Budget column represents your estimated expenses, while the Actual column reflects the actual amount deducted from your checking account for those expenses. For instance, you may budget $850 for rent, but your utility bills, like Avista, fluctuate based on usage. It's wise to budget for the worst-case scenario to ensure you have enough funds.

By documenting both budgeted and actual expenses, you gain a clear picture of any discrepancies. If you estimate $350 for Avista but spend only $250, this indicates you have $100 sitting idle in your checking account without a specific purpose. This is where zero-based budgeting comes into play â€“ every dollar of your income should be allocated to a specific expense.

Unallocated funds can lead to impulsive spending or inadequate planning for impending financial goals. Therefore, comparing your estimates to actual spending ensures that every dollar has a designated purpose. In the video, you'll see an example of how the author tracks her bills online and leaves the full budgeted amount in her checking account. However, upon comparing budgeted and actual expenses, she discovers a discrepancy of several hundred dollars.

With this information, she can decide to roll over unused cash envelope funds, contribute to a vacation savings goal, or pay down debt. The key is to identify when funds in your checking account lack a plan and take appropriate action.

Similarly, if your Actual column exceeds your Budget column, it indicates that you've overspent. This prompts you to assess your options and decide whether to use savings to cover the shortfall or adjust your spending habits.

The "Budget by Paycheck Workbook" also includes space to track actual spending for your cash envelopes. This column reflects the exact amount spent from each envelope. It's important to distinguish between the total cash allocated to an envelope and the actual amount used.

Understanding the difference between budgeted and actual spending empowers you with financial awareness and allows you to make informed decisions. By tracking this information diligently, you can avoid overspending, maximize savings, and achieve your financial goals more effectively.
