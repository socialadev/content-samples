# The Cashless Envelope Method

In this video, I'll guide you through the cashless envelope method, an alternative to using physical cash envelopes for budgeting. I've been an all-cash spender for years, but due to the pandemic, I decided to try the cashless method and document my experience.

The cashless envelope method involves using tracking cards instead of cash envelopes. These cards help you track your spending in each budget category. You'll have one tracking card for each variable spending category, such as groceries, entertainment, and gas.

Like the cash envelope method, the cashless method helps you become more aware of your spending. You can see the instant consequences of your purchases, as your balance updates in real-time. This awareness is crucial for making informed spending decisions.

One significant difference between the two methods is that with the cashless method, everything comes out of your checking account. This means you'll only need one expense tracker, which tracks both your bills and variable spending.

In my April budget, I have category limits for each envelope, just like I would in a regular cash envelope budget. However, instead of using cash envelopes, I'm using tracking cards to keep track of my spending.

The cashless method provides similar benefits to the cash envelope method, such as increased financial awareness. While it may not have the same psychological impact as handling physical cash, the awareness it fosters is equally important.
