# Can't stick to a budget? Try these tweaks instead | Your Money and Your Mind

Most budgeting techniques prove ineffective due to the inflexible nature of fixed expenses like rent and utilities. Instead, consider a "frequency budget" that focuses on controlling the number of times you engage in discretionary spending activities, such as eating out. This approach is easier to track and adhere to, making it more effective for managing frequent, small purchases.

Regarding dining expenses, research has shown that eating out ranks among the most financially regretted expenses. To combat this, establish a "frequency budget" for dining out, rather than a monetary budget. This way, you can limit the number of times you indulge in restaurant meals, making it easier to save money while still enjoying occasional social outings with friends.

Delivery services, while convenient, often result in higher spending due to hidden fees and upcharges. To avoid overspending, delete delivery apps from your phone or create speed bumps to slow down the pace of purchases. One strategy is to link the app to a debit card with a limited balance, ensuring you don't exceed your intended spending.

For shopping, prioritize purchases that bring you genuine happiness and fulfillment, such as spending on experiences, gifts for others, or time-saving services. Research suggests that these expenses yield greater satisfaction compared to retail therapy. By making mindful choices and investing in experiences or services that enhance your well-being, you can maximize happiness and reduce regretful spending.
